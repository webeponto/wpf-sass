Study the WPF3 Framework documentation to understand its features, components, and best practices through the three main documentation files:

- Search for a file called `wpf3-framework.instructions.md`. It represents the overall architecture and design principles of the WPF3 Framework, as well as a detailed description about what it is;
- Search for a file called `wpf.config.yaml`. This file contains configuration settings and references for the WPF3 Framework, including information about available components, styles, and best practices.
- Search for a file called `render.js`. This file is responsible for the rendering logic within the WPF3 Framework, including how components are displayed and updated on the screen.

After reviewing these files, you should have a comprehensive understanding of the WPF3 Framework and its components, which will help you in your development tasks.

When the user uses this prompt to ask you something, you should be able to provide accurate and relevant information exclusively for the WPF3 Framwework as quickly as possible. Don't take too much time to answer.

Then, if the user asks for something related to a CSS specific class or attribute, present him with the available options compatible with the WPF3 Framework and teach him/her about how to use it.
