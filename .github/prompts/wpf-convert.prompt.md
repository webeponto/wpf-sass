Use your WPF3 Framwework knowledge obtained from the WPF3 Instruction Files to convert any WPF2 classes into WPF3 compatible classes.

Investigate all the files attached or mentioned by the user and search for a file called *wpf2-legacy.scss* (The Legacy WPF2 Stylesheet) and the *wpf.config.yaml* (The WPF3 Reference Guide) to help you detect all the WPF2 legacy utility classes to convert it into the proper WPF3 substitutes.

If you need any further guidance into this task, don't hesitate to rely on the proper instruction files related to the WPF3 Framework, like:

- *wpf3-framework.instructions.md*: For overall knowledge about the WPF3 latest features and overall capabilities;
- *wpf3-autofixer.instructions.md*: For guidance on how to automatically fix possible issues within the WPF3 infrastructure;
- *wpf3-bugs.instructions.md*: For understanding and troubleshooting bugs within the WPF3 framework.

After the process is complete, ensure that all the converted classes are tested and validated to work correctly within the WPF3 framework.

Finally, provide a summary of the changes made, including any challenges faced during the conversion process and how they were resolved.
